### Instructions

**Requires HTTP Mode enabled on Primary**
*Working on allowing https mode, but presently only expected to work with a primary which allows http communications*

Navigate to the `âš™CM Settings' tab and provide your CM Servers FQDN or netbios name, then the three letter site code.  The tool **will not** work without both.

Then switch to the **Naming** tab and provide your client base name and the starting and ending device IDs you'd like to create in CM.

Then hit 'Ready' from the main tab when you're ready to go!

*These settings are now saved between launches of the application!*

The client should appear within CM in ten seconds or so!  Hardware Inventory will take a bit longer to appear.

### Providing Custom Inventory

### Reconciliation and Reporting

All devices created with ClientFaux recieve the custom DDR property of `ClientType : FakeClient`, you can use this property to exclude all fake Clients, or to exclude them instead in your reports and Collections.

### Troubleshooting 

Check `DDM.Log` and `mpcontrol.log` on the ConfigMgr primary site for troubleshooting information and also the `\SMS_CCM\Logs\MP_RegistrationManager.log` file for additional troubleshooting.  Now also creates client side logging as well, which will be found in the working directory of the app, as `DebugCMLog.log`
