# ClientFaux - Client Simulation Tool
A tool for adding simulated CM Clients to ConfigMgr for collection querying, report building, and testing ConfigMgr environments.  [Read the blog post here.](https://foxdeploy.com/2018/06/08/how-to-populate-cm-with-fake-clients/)

[![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/Want%20to%20try%3F-Download%20Now!-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/1RedOne/ClientFaux/releases)

### Setting up the environment

There is now practically no setup to the tool, simply download the newest release from releases above!  Run the installer then launch ClientFaux as a standard user account (or admin, doesn't matter).

Navigate to the `⚙CM Settings' tab and provide your CM Servers FQDN or netbios name, then the three letter site code.  The tool **will not** work without both.

Then switch to the **Naming** tab and provide your client base name and the starting and ending device IDs you'd like to create in CM.

Then hit 'Ready' from the main tab when you're ready to go!

The client should appear within CM in ten seconds or so!  Hardware Inventory will take a bit longer to appear.
